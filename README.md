  ## Description
  The motivation for this project was to set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data. I built this project to refactor the existing RESTful API with the GraphQL API. I learned how to create an Apollo Provider to communicate with the Apollo Server, implement GraphQL queries and mutations and deploy to Heroku with a MongoDB database.
